# Intro to JavaScript

In this repo you find a tour that takes you through the basics of JavaScript. 

We have a look at objects, arrays and functions. 

To take the tour, clone this repo and open it with visual studio code. You need to have the extension [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour)  installed. 

There are 2 branches in this repo:
- main (with the starting tour). In this branch you find the JavaScript code for the shop. 
- dom: In this branch you also find a index.html with some content and we extend the JavaScript to also include Dom Manipulation. There is also a tour for this on the branch! To get to this branch and see the tour, clone this project to your computer, open the command line and type `git checkout dom` and press enter.
